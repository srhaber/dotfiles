## Version Control

Git and GitHub integration tools.

| Package | Purpose | Notes |
|---------|---------|-------|
| **git** | Distributed version control | Core VCS |
| **git-lfs** | Git Large File Storage | Handles large binary files in git repos |
| **gh** | GitHub CLI | Official GitHub CLI for PRs, issues, actions (replaces deprecated `hub`) |

**Custom git configuration:** See [.config/git/](.config/git/) for custom aliases, helpers, and global ignore patterns.

**Key git aliases:**
- `git l` - Pretty formatted log
- `git b` - Pretty formatted branches
- `git bs` - Branches sorted by commit date
- `git hp` - Show head commit with diff

---

## Programming Languages & Runtimes

Language installations and version managers. Version managers are preferred over direct installations for flexibility across projects.

| Package | Language | Type | Notes |
|---------|----------|------|-------|
| **go** | Go | Direct install | Single version, manually update as needed |
| **node** | Node.js | Direct install | Base installation |
| **nodenv** | Node.js | Version manager | Manage multiple Node.js versions per project |
| **pyenv** | Python | Version manager | Manage Python versions (preferred over `brew install python@X.Y`) |
| **rust** | Rust | Direct install | Includes cargo package manager |
| **openjdk@11** | Java | Direct install | Java 11 LTS with link to system java |

**Important:** For Python, use `pyenv` to install specific versions rather than installing `python@3.x` via brew. This provides better project isolation and version management.

**nvm alternative:** While `nodenv` is included for Node version management, you can also use `nvm` (install manually from [github.com/nvm-sh/nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm)). The [.zshrc](.zshrc) is configured to load nvm if present.

---

## Terminal & Shell

Terminal multiplexer and prompt enhancement.

| Package | Purpose | Configuration |
|---------|---------|---------------|
| **tmux** | Terminal multiplexer | Config: [.tmux.conf](.tmux.conf) - Enables split panes, session persistence |
| **starship** | Cross-shell prompt | Config: [.config/starship.toml](.config/starship.toml) - Shows git status, timestamps, exit codes |

**Starship features:** Fast, shows git branch/status, language versions, command duration, and custom timestamps with timezone.

**Starship config highlights:**
- Full date/time format: `%F %T %Z`
- Shows day of week
- Exit code display on failure
- Custom format without "at" prefix

---

## Kubernetes & Container Orchestration

| Package | Purpose | Interface |
|---------|---------|-----------|
| **kubernetes-cli** | kubectl | Command-line interface for Kubernetes clusters |
| **k9s** | Kubernetes TUI | Terminal UI for managing k8s clusters - navigate, inspect, manage resources with keyboard |

**k9s** is a powerful TUI that makes k8s management faster than raw kubectl commands. Features include:
- Real-time cluster resource monitoring
- Interactive pod logs and shell access
- Quick resource deletion/editing
- Vim-like keybindings

---

## Infrastructure as Code

Terraform tooling with version management.

| Package | Purpose | Why Version Manager |
|---------|---------|---------------------|
| **tfenv** | Terraform version manager | Different projects often require different Terraform versions |
| **tgenv** | Terragrunt version manager | Manages Terragrunt versions alongside Terraform |

**Usage examples:**
```bash
# Terraform version management
tfenv list-remote         # List available versions
tfenv install 1.6.0       # Install specific version
tfenv use 1.6.0          # Use specific version
tfenv list               # List installed versions

# Terragrunt version management
tgenv list-remote
tgenv install 0.55.0
tgenv use 0.55.0
```

**Project-specific versions:** Create `.terraform-version` or `.terragrunt-version` files in project roots to automatically switch versions.

---

## Build Tools & CI/CD

Build systems and artifact management for large-scale projects.

| Package | Purpose | Use Case |
|---------|---------|----------|
| **bazelisk** | Bazel launcher | Automatically downloads correct Bazel version (Google's build system) |
| **jfrog-cli** | JFrog CLI | Interact with JFrog Artifactory for artifact management |
| **watchman** | File watcher | Watches file changes, triggers builds (used by React Native, Metro bundler, etc.) |

**Bazelisk:** Reads `.bazelversion` file in project root and automatically uses the correct Bazel version. Eliminates "works on my machine" issues.

**Watchman:** High-performance file watching service. More efficient than filesystem polling, especially for large codebases.

---

echo '{"name":"value"}' | jq '.name'
jq '.items[] | select(.price > 10)' products.json
```

**yq examples:**
```bash
yq eval '.spec.containers[0].image' deployment.yaml
yq -o json eval deployment.yaml  # Convert YAML to JSON
```

rsync -avz --delete source/ dest/  # Sync and delete files not in source
```

---

## Security & Certificates

TLS/SSL certificate management for local development.

| Package | Purpose | Usage |
|---------|---------|-------|
| **mkcert** | Local certificate generator | Create locally-trusted HTTPS certificates for development |
| **nss** | Network Security Services | Mozilla's security library (required by some apps for certificate handling) |

**mkcert setup:**

mkcert example.local localhost     # Create certificate for domains
mkcert "*.example.local"          # Wildcard certificate
```

Certificates are automatically trusted by browsers and system. No more security warnings in local development!

| **shfmt** | Shell formatter | Format shell scripts with consistent style |

**shfmt usage:**
```bash
shfmt -i 2 -w script.sh    # Format with 2-space indent, write back
shfmt -d .                 # Check formatting (dry-run)
```

Configured to format with 2-space indentation, simplify code, and follow Google's shell style guide.

---

## Android Development

Android-specific development tools.

| Package | Purpose | Usage |
|---------|---------|-------|
| **pidcat** | Colored logcat | Filter and color Android logcat output by app package name |

**pidcat usage:**
```bash
pidcat com.example.app           # Show logs for specific app
pidcat com.example.app -t MyTag  # Filter by tag
```

Much more readable than raw `adb logcat` with automatic color coding by log level.

## Package Selection Philosophy

This Brewfile follows these principles:

1. **Version managers over direct installs** - Use `pyenv`, `nodenv`, `tfenv`, etc. for flexibility
2. **Modern CLI tools** - Prefer faster, more user-friendly alternatives (ripgrep, fd, bat, etc.)
3. **Essential only** - Only include tools that are regularly used or hard to install otherwise
4. **Avoid redundancy** - Remove deprecated tools (hub → gh), prefer single solution per category
5. **Declarative infrastructure** - Everything in Brewfile for reproducibility

---
